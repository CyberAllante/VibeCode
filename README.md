# Allante`s Vibe‑Coded Project Portfolio 🔒


I'm passionate about building and shipping AI-assisted apps fast with Vibe-style workflows. With over 10 years of experience in IT operations, networking, and security, I’ve managed enterprise infrastructure, led IT asset recovery with law enforcement, and deployed large-scale technology across 30+ sites:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Certified in CySA+, Pentest+, and ISC2 CC, I bring a strong foundation in security operations, vulnerability management, and incident response:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}—now applying that expertise to building AI-powered security and automation tools.
